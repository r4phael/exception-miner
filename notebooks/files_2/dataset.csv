this does introduce a potential new bug:
```

cdef ok1(just_float x):
    return just_float in floating

cdef fail1(just_float x, floating y):

fail1 and fail2 work before this patch but fail with it. it isn't
clear to me if this should actually be considered a bug. it
works in both versions with `cython.floating`, which possibly
suggests analyse_as_type in attributenode should also be changed

173,cython,0,4,issue,3542,"fix cygdb (gh-3542)

* cython debugger documentation: added link to an installation script.
* got a new libpython.py from the cpython source distribution.
* default language level in tests is now 3 instead of 2
* migrated codefile from python 2 to python 3.
* added testcase for the cy list command in cygdb.
* temporarily removing test case that freezes gdb.
* fixed a bug that broke several cygdb tests.

the cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* files map the names of the c-functions generated by the cython compiler to the names of the functions in the *.pyx source. if the function was defined using ""def"" (and not ""cpdef"" or ""cdef"") in the *.pyx source file, the c-function named in cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* used to be __pyx_pw_*, which is the name of the wrapper function and now it is __pyx_f_*, which is the name of the actual function. this makes some cygdb tests pass that did not pass before.

* better error messages: if a cygdb command raises, a traceback will be printed.
* fixed a bug in cygdb.

the following now works:
1. start cygdb
2. type ""cy exec"" and hit enter
3. type some other lines
4. type ""end"" and hit enter.
-> these ""other lines"" will get executed

* fixed a bug in cygdb: cy list now works outside of functions.
* added print_hr_allmarkers function for easier debugging.
* fixed a bug that broke cygdb:

cy break did not work if you put the breakpoint outside of a function if there was e.g. the following somewhere in your *.pyx file:
cdef class someclass():
    pass

* added a cygdb test for printing global variables.
* fixing cygdb: replaced cy print with a simple, working solution.
* if an exception in cygdb occurs, a stacktrace will be printed.

some of the shortest_path functions have a fast-path for the case when source==target.
in some of these functions, there was no check that the source node was in the graph,
leading to incorrect results when a nodenotfound error would be more appropriate.
this pr fixes these cases.

in addition, checking that nodes are actually in the graph was formerly done in the internal
`_dijkstra_multisource` function. these checks have been factored out and moved to the
client functions for efficiency and to prevent redundant checking.

fixes #6220

co-authored-by: maximilian friedersdorff <max@friedersdorff.com>
co-authored-by: maybe-sybr <58414429+maybe-sybr@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix: ensure all subtasks of a group get errbacks

giving a linked task callback to the 0th task in a group is fine, but
for errbacks it's not an appropriate choice since any task in the group
could fail. this ensures that if any task other than the 0th one fails,
the errback will be called. this opens the possibility for an errback to
be called more than once when linked to a group, but generally we expect
that they should be design to be idempotent so no warning is issued for
the changed behaviour.

* test: add tests for child error propagation

* test: add regression tests for group errback dupes

these tests simply encode the currently expected behaviour where
errbacks linked to a group will be called once for each failed task, as
well as the consequences for chords which turn their header into a group
if it is not one already.

* doc: add extra docs for canvas call/errback usage

* fix redundant yaml error blurbs on modargs parse errors

some of the ansibleparsererrors from parsing.mod_args
are created with the obj=some_yaml_ds options but
some are not.

if they were, we don't want to add another yaml_ds to
it, because that will result in double yaml error blurbs.
and since we dont need to add info, we can just re raise it.

but if there is no ._obj, add it here so we get the extra
detail in the error message (see issue #14790) and raise
a new ansibleparsererror instance.

this patch:

* updates nrt.c to ensure that allocation routines return null if
  the allocation fails. cf. malloc.
* updates the nrt.context to add a check that wraps any allocation
  routine to check if the allocation failed and if so raises a
  memoryerror.
* fixes the runtime system allocators to catch invalid allocation
  requests and handle failed allocation requests.
* adds tests for the above.
* fixes a storage classifier issue in the c code in the nrt tests.
* adds the option `--debuginfo` to the `build_ext` command in
  setup.py, on unix systems this will ensure the dsos numba
  produces are built with debug symbols.
* adds an update to the notes in nrt_external.h about the expected

287,ansible,0,6,issue,57038,"make query with errors='ignore' return a blank list (#57038)

the jinja2 query() function (or lookup with wantslist=true, which is
the same thing) should always return a list.

however, if you combine a query with errors='ignore' and take the
error path, the current code returns a none value.  this is important
in a case such as

 - name: conditional include file
   import_tasks: '{{ item }}'
   vars:
     params:
       files:
         - path/file1.yaml
         - path/file2.yaml
   loop: ""{{ q('first_found', params, errors='ignore') }}""

if neither file1.yaml or file2.yaml exist, this should do nothing by
returning an empty list to the loop.  currently if you run the above
task you'll get a rather unhelpful:

 invalid data passed to 'loop', it requires a list, got this instead: .

this change ensures that when a query ignores an error, it returns a
empty list.  the errors='ignore' case is tested in several variants
with first_found.  the extant (but deprecated) ""skip: true"" for
first_found doesn't seem to be explicitly tested; a test is added here
to avoid regressions before removal in 2.12.

this fixes a regression you'll hit if you follow the suggestion in the
deprecation message included with
e17a2b502d6601be53c60d7ba1c627df419460c9 to use errors=ignore over
""skip: true"" for first_found.  this change adds an example that points
out the query/lookup difference and also fixes the error message to
not mention the now deprecated ""skip: true"".

this works around issues with source that cannot be parsed when
looking for a line containing `def` so as to get the correct line
info for use in debuginfo emission. it adds tests for this and
also the case where the function source is simply unobtainable.

the if_exists argument in io.sql.write_frame needed data validation
because the logic of the function implicitly used 'append' if the argument
value was any string that was not either 'fail' or 'replace'.
i added a new unit test to support the requirement.

bug: fix if_exists='replace' functionality in io.sql.write_frame

this should resolve issues #2971 and #4110

cln: refactor in between test clean ups to be more dry

tst: complete test coverage for if_exists uses in io.sql.write_frame

cln: refactor to make interaction between exists and if_exists clearer

this refactor results in the function logic being clearer, since if_exists is
only relevant when exists is true, the program flow is better served to
have if_exists control flow only when exists is true

420,pytest,0,8,issue,37,"let unittest frameworks deal with async functions

instead of trying to handle unittest-async functions in pytest_pyfunc_call,
let the unittest framework handle them instead.

this lets us remove the hack in pytest_pyfunc_call, with the upside that
we should support any unittest-async based framework.

also included 'asynctest' as test dependency for py37-twisted, and renamed
'twisted' to 'unittestextras' to better reflect that we install 'twisted' and
'asynctest' now.

this also fixes the problem of cleanup functions not being properly called
for async functions.

430,pandas,0,8,issue,4835,"enh: pytables start/stop/selection fixes and select_as_mutlipe change

this commit fixes issues with start/stop and selection. furthermore
select_as_mutlipe is implemented differently:
- select_column and remove now hanlde start/stop arguments
- select_as_multipe hanldes start/stop the same way as select
- select_as_coordinates and select_column works with where expressions
  that result in filters. this also fixes select_as_multipe with filters
- select_as_multipe table iterator is rewritting, so memory usage is
  constant.

select_as_multiple now will always throw a keyerror if either a key or
the selector is not found.

if no netrc environment variable is provided and the .netrc path cannot
be accessed due to missing permission, a permissionerror was raised
instead of returning none. see issue #7237. this pr fixes the issue.

if the changes look good, i can also prepare backports.

## are there changes in behavior for the user?

if the .netrc cannot be accessed due to a permission problem (and the
`netrc` environment variable is unset), no `permissionerror` will be
raised. instead it will be silently ignored.

* changes based on the review

* fix tmpdir when makedirs failed so we just use the system tmp

* let missing remote_tmp fail

if remote_tmp is missing then there's something more basic wrong in the
communication from the controller to the module-side.  it's better to
be alerted in this case than to silently ignore it.

jborean and i have independently checked what happens if the user sets
ansible_remote_tmp to empty string and !!null and both cases work fine.
(null is turned into a default value controller-side.  empty string
triggers the warning because it is probably not a directory that the
become user is able to use).",Jordan Borean,2018-07-07 03:49:19+10:00,FALSE,"needs_revision,test,module,net_tools,support:community,support:core,bug,affects_2.7",https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42396,True,S,Exceptional error,Improper Handling,Add a exception handling block,N,S,Exceptional error,Improper Handling,Add a exception handling block,Incorrect Exceptions,Incorrect Exceptions,Missing Exception Type,Improper Exception Handling,Add a exception handling block,Improve the exception handling block,0.0,3.0,59.0,8bdd04c147470b5fc3367c8e82ae41c2d2e6d989,https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42396,https://github.com/ansible/ansible,12.0,212.0,11.0,23.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,48.0,N,,,,,,

581,scipy,1,2,issue,7847,"bug: linalg: fix speed regression in solve()

this fixes the speed regression in gh-7847. since the default
change of sv to svx the solve routine suffered a huge performance
penalty for anything but low order nrhs.

this commit fixes that issue by converting to the sx routines,
with condition number checking.

however, the main funtionality by using svx was the easy check
of the condition number to assert a non-singular matrix.
this commit adds a call to the con routines to extract the
appropriate condition number. this forces the addition of:

   - lamch (machine precision extraction)
   - gecon (condition number calculation from lu factorization)
   - lange (1/i-norm of matrix)

this commit adds a valueerror issued for complex matrices
an transposed=true (which was a bug in prior versions).
the complex transposed case could be solved, but it is ambiguous whether
it should be the transposed or hermitian transposed. hence, a valueerror is
raised. see master (#7879) for a fix.

a couple of additional tests have been added, mainly to check the arguments.",Nick Papior,2017-09-19 11:15:52+02:00,FALSE,"defect,scipy.linalg",https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7847,True,S,Exceptional error,Missing Raising Condition,Raise errors,N,S,Exceptional error,Missing Raising Condition,Raise errors,Incorrect Exceptions,Incorrect Exceptions,Missing Raising Condition,Improper Raising,Add a raise condition,Improve raising conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this fixes a cluster of bugs that prevented referencing schema-level
aliases from other schema-level aliases properly:

- `declare_view_from_schema` should populate the compilation context
  sufficiently to properly resolve alias innards, but should otherwise
  return the aliased type variant exactly as it is already defined in
  the schema.  this is achieved through the addition of a special
  `recompiling_schema_alias` mode, which performs alias declaration
  as usual, but reuses the existing schema objects instead of creating
  them;

- aliases of aliases reuse nested aliased types, hence `drop alias`
  needs to be careful not to blindly destroy them (`if_unused` comes
  handy here).

* [wip] attempt introduce test skips for invalid versions of pandas

* [wip] test to try to fix bug with pandas ~0.25 in expect_column_values_to_be_in_type_list

* [wip] another attempt at a bugfix. the issue appears to be with numpy <1.21 rather than with pandas.

* since numpy was the issue rather than pandas 0.25, and that was dealt with in the type checking function, we can expand the nullable int test to include pandas 0.25

672,numpy,1,3,issue,13056,"bug: fixes to numpy.distutils.configuration.get_version (#13056)

* bug: use subprocess.check_output to avoid leaking file handles

this emitted a resourcewarning as previously written, as the streams never got closed.

this change also detects errors in `svnversion` and `hg`, rather than ignoring the error code and hoping stdout contains a revision anyway.

* bug: fix distutils.get_version on python 3

previously, this would throw `typeerror: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`, which would then be silenced and never seen.

the previous commit stopped silencing this error, so now everything is visibly broken rather than silently broken

different connection plugins return different data when throwing exceptions. the paramiko connection plugin does not return a text sting, which caused an exception.

the ssh connection plugin returns multi-line errors, which makes the debug logs harder to read. only return the last line in that case in order to make the logs more readable.

when experiencing a connection failure, reset the connection.

add reset() to paramiko_ssh

indicate thet conection state is false when running close(). this is needed by the ensure_connected() decorator to work properly.

     construction of multi numeric dtypes with other types in a dict

     added blocks attribute (and as_blocks()) method that returns a dict of dtype -> homogeneous frame to dataframe
     added keyword 'raise_on_error' to astype, which can be set to false to exluded non-numeric columns
     fixed merging to correctly merge on multiple dtypes with blocks (e.g. float64 and float32 in other merger)
     changed implementation of get_dtype_counts() to use .blocks
     revised dataframe.convert_objects to use blocks to be more efficient
     added dtype printing to show on default with a series
     added convert_dates='coerce' option to convert_objects, to force conversions to datetime64[ns]
     where can upcast integer to float as needed (on inplace ops #2793)
     added fully cythonized support for int8/int16
     no support for float16 (it can exist, but no cython methods for it)

tst: fixed test in test_from_records_sequencelike (dict orders can be different on different arch!)
       note: using tuples will remove dtype info from the input stream (using a record array is ok though!)
     test updates for merging (multi-dtypes)
     added tests for replace (but skipped for now, algos not set for float32/16)
     tests for astype and convert in internals

     separated out test_from_records_dictlike
     testing of panel constructors (gh #797)

     allow slightly less sensitive decimal tests for less precise dtypes

bug: fixed gh #2778, fillna on empty frame causes seg fault
     fixed bug in groupby where types were not being casted to original dtype
     respect the dtype of non-natural numeric (decimal)
     don't upcast ints/bools to floats (if you say were agging on len, you can get an int)
doc: added astype conversion examples to whatsnew and docs (dsintro)
     updated release notes
     whatsnew for 0.10.2
     added upcasting gotchas docs

cln: updated convert_objects to be more consistent across frame/series
     moved most groupby functions out of algos.pyx to generated.pyx
     fully support cython functions for pad/bfill/take/diff/groupby for float32

733,discord.py,1,5,issue,"ensure explicitly set parents on nested groups are respected

this had a multiple layer bug that needed to be squashed. the first
issue was that setting `parent=...` inside a `group` wouldn't actually
add the `group` into the `parent` children mapping. this meant that
it didn't actually end up copying the children when it came time to
within e.g. a cog.

the second issue was that even if it was added into the children
listing, it wouldn't properly set the attribute.

this commit fixes both of these issues.

correctly detecting updates.

there were also several minor issues found that were causing issues with
truly idepotent updates/changes to the host definition.

this patch also provides some unit tests and integration tests to help
catch future issues in these areas.

fixes #28272

748,salt,1,5,issue,"fix issue #11727: got a bad pillar from master

i was able to reproduce this issue consistently in my environment.

the minion would receive an empty string '' as pillar data instead of
the expected pillar data. the reason for this is that in
salt/master.py: _pillar()
it would invoke:
for func in six.itervalues(self.mminion.functions):

which would cause a _load_all() in salt/loader.py

this would eventually cause an exception when loading:
salt/modules/boto_vpc.py (at line 113):
__utils__['boto.assign_funcs'](__name__, 'vpc')

with: keyerror('boto.assign_funcs',)
which probably means that 'boto.assign_funcs' isn't in __utils__ at the
time of invocation.

however, this commit will not fix the problem in boto_vpc.py. i will
leave this up to a domain expert.

the focus of this commit is to make the loader capable of cleanly
handling errors while invoking '__init__' in loaded modules.

769,octoprint,1,5,issue,"🐛 fix exception not being retrieved on socket error

this should hopefully close #3689

the actual result of writing to the web socket is async and a future,
since `write_message` (https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/v5.1.1/tornado/websocke.py#l848)
returns a future. the error handling inside `send_pack` however
so far assumed synchronous behaviour (same for `rawwebsocket.py`).
thus the exception handler there will not trigger if there's an error
while writing, and thus the connection will not have `on_close` called.

this commit works around this through a `done_callback` on the future,
which should hopefully solve it. i say should because even though i did
my best in trying to simulate the error scenario, i was never able to
trigger even the ""retrieved"" message, let alone a whole storm of them.",Gina Häußge,2020-09-04 17:37:29+02:00,FALSE,"unreproduced,bug,done,approved",e91fcd6387c96d8aa92070f7a14b6558773446d1,https://github.com/octoprint/octoprint/issues/3689,True,S,"Exceptional

closes #12678

`read_csv` bugs, this pr fixes a bug brought up in #9755 in processing
`parse_dates` with the c engine in which the wrong indices (those of
the filtered column names) were being used to determine the date
columns to not be dtype-parsed by the c engine. the correct indices
are those of the original column names, as they are used later on in
the actual data processing.

812,mlflow,1,5,issue,"fix bug when environment run id overrides set_experiment (#1820)

## what changes are proposed in this pull request?

adds a check in `start_run()` to make sure `_active_experiment_id` isn't set by `set_experiment()` when a run id is supplied by the environment. the main reason this happens is when `--experiment-name` or `--experiment-id` is set from the cli, it will create a run on that experiment. afterwards, a user might assume they can also reference the run with `set_experiment()`, maybe providing a different name to override the cli. before, it would allow the user to use `set_experiment()` and it would create a new experiment from `set_experiment()`, however it would log results to the experiment set from cli. now, it will throw an `mlflowexception` if both are set.

815,ansible,1,5,issue,"prevent losing unsafe from lookups (#77609)

* prevent losing unsafe from lookups

this patch fixes a bug which under certain conditions results in data
returned from lookups not being marked as unsafe.

each time templar.do_template is invoked a new ansiblecontext is
created and stored effectively at two places:
1) as an instance variable in templar_obj.cur_context
2) as a local variable called new_context in do_template method of templar

due to custom functionality in ansible's context that allows for nested
templating it is possible that during resolving variable's value
template/do_template method is called recursively again, again creating
a new context. at that point the problem manifests itself because as
mentioned in 1) above the context is overwriten on the templar object
which means that any subsequent calls to _lookup will use the new
context to mark it as unsafe which is now different to the local
new_context which is used for testing for unsafe property.

the solution to the problem appears to be to restore the original
context inside do_template and also to eliminate the local variable
new_context to prevent problems in the future.

it appears that we don't have a better way of storing the context other
than as some form of global variable and so this appears to be the
""best"" solution possible at this point. hopefully data tagging will be
the solution here.

for more examples see unit and integration tests included in this patch.

in essence gathered a bunch of out of bounds indices, leading to apparently
incorrect gradients.

this reverts commit c088383cb290ca064d456e89d79177a0e234cb8d and
uses the same kind casting rule for the additional keyword arguments
``to_end`` and ``to_begin``. this results in slightly more leniant
behaviour for integers (which can now have overflows that are
hidden), but fixes an issue with the handling of nan.
generally, this behaviour seems more conistent with what numpy does
elsewhere. the overflow issue exists similar in many other places
and should be solved by integer overflow warning machinery while
the actual cast takes place.

  that should be fixed in a devel-only change

  only .py files

* if there is no documentation entry in the plugin, raise an exception
  from _get_plugin_doc().  everywhere we use _get_plugin_doc(), this is
  treated as an error

* if there is no ansible_metadata raise an exception as well as
  displaying of docs assumes that this has been set.

* if there is neither documentation nor ansible_metadata, warn about the
  lack of metadata and error on the lack of documentation.  lack of
  documentation is more important so it is what the user should see.

* add a few special cases for backwards compat.  these should probably
