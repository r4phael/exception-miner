292,zulip,0,4,issue,2016,"cve-2016-4427: fix access by deactivated realms/users.

the security model for deactivated users (and users in deactivated
realms) being unable to access the service is intended to work via two
mechanisms:

* all active user sessions are deleted, and all login code paths
  (where a user could get a new session) check whether the user (or
  realm) is inactive before authorizing the request, preventing the
  user from accessing the website and ajax endpoints.
* all api code paths (which don't require a session) check whether the
  user (and realm) are active.

however, this security model was not implemented correctly.  in
particular, the check for whether a user has an active account in the
login process was done inside the login form's validators, which meant
that authentication mechanisms that did not use the login form
(e.g. google and remote_user auth) could succeed in granting a session
even with an inactive account.  the zulip homepage would still fail to
load because the code for / includes an api call to tornado authorized
by the user's token that would fail, but this mechanism could allow an
inactive user to access realm data or users to access data in a
deactivated realm.

this fixes the issue by adding explicit checks for inactive users and
inactive realms in all authentication backends (even those that were
already protected by the login form validator).

mirror dummy users are already inactive, so we can remove the explicit
code around mirror dummy users.

the following commits add a complete set of tests for zulip's inactive
user and realm security model.",Tim Abbott,2016-04-20 22:19:08-07:00,FALSE,"bug,area: real-time sync,area: stream settings",https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/2016,True,N,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,,,-,-,Add apropriated exception type,Exception type operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

308,cython,0,4,issue,3205,"make c++ typeid accept specializations of fused types (#3205)

* potential fix for gh issue #3203

gets the specialized type if possible from
namenode.analyse_as_type

this does introduce a potential new bug:
```
cimport cython

just_float = cython.fused_type(float)

cdef ok1(just_float x):
    return just_float in floating

cdef fail1(just_float x, floating y):
    return just_float in floating

cdef fail2(floating x):
    return floating in floating

def show():
    """"""
    >>> show()

    print(fail1(1.0, 2.0))
    print(fail1[float, double](1.0, 2.0))
    print(fail2[float](1.0))
```
fail1 and fail2 work before this patch but fail with it. it isn't
clear to me if this should actually be considered a bug. it
works in both versions with `cython.floating`, which possibly
suggests analyse_as_type in attributenode should also be changed

312,cython,0,4,issue,3542,"fix cygdb (gh-3542)

* cython debugger documentation: added link to an installation script.
* got a new libpython.py from the cpython source distribution.
* default language level in tests is now 3 instead of 2
* migrated codefile from python 2 to python 3.
* added testcase for the cy list command in cygdb.
* temporarily removing test case that freezes gdb.
* fixed a bug that broke several cygdb tests.

the cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* files map the names of the c-functions generated by the cython compiler to the names of the functions in the *.pyx source. if the function was defined using ""def"" (and not ""cpdef"" or ""cdef"") in the *.pyx source file, the c-function named in cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* used to be __pyx_pw_*, which is the name of the wrapper function and now it is __pyx_f_*, which is the name of the actual function. this makes some cygdb tests pass that did not pass before.

* better error messages: if a cygdb command raises, a traceback will be printed.
* fixed a bug in cygdb.

the following now works:
1. start cygdb
2. type ""cy exec"" and hit enter
3. type some other lines
4. type ""end"" and hit enter.
-> these ""other lines"" will get executed

* fixed a bug in cygdb: cy list now works outside of functions.
* added print_hr_allmarkers function for easier debugging.
* fixed a bug that broke cygdb:

cy break did not work if you put the breakpoint outside of a function if there was e.g. the following somewhere in your *.pyx file:
cdef class someclass():
    pass

* added a cygdb test for printing global variables.
* fixing cygdb: replaced cy print with a simple, working solution.
* if an exception in cygdb occurs, a stacktrace will be printed.
* fixed a bug that broke cy break -p
* bugfix: the compiler now writes out correctly which cython linenumber and path corresponds to which c linenumber.

331,networkx,0,4,issue,5023,"bug fix for issue #5023 :  corner-case bug in single_source_dijkstra (#5033)

some of the shortest_path functions have a fast-path for the case when source==target.
in some of these functions, there was no check that the source node was in the graph,
leading to incorrect results when a nodenotfound error would be more appropriate.
this pr fixes these cases.

in addition, checking that nodes are actually in the graph was formerly done in the internal
`_dijkstra_multisource` function. these checks have been factored out and moved to the
client functions for efficiency and to prevent redundant checking.

co-authored-by: maybe-sybr <58414429+maybe-sybr@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix: ensure all subtasks of a group get errbacks

giving a linked task callback to the 0th task in a group is fine, but
for errbacks it's not an appropriate choice since any task in the group
could fail. this ensures that if any task other than the 0th one fails,
the errback will be called. this opens the possibility for an errback to
be called more than once when linked to a group, but generally we expect
that they should be design to be idempotent so no warning is issued for
the changed behaviour.

* test: add tests for child error propagation

* test: add regression tests for group errback dupes

these tests simply encode the currently expected behaviour where
errbacks linked to a group will be called once for each failed task, as
well as the consequences for chords which turn their header into a group
if it is not one already.

scipy/optimize/_removeredundancy.py contains a function
_removeredundancy that is used in the presolve procedure of
the interior point method. it's in a separate file as
scipy/optimize/_linprog/_linprog_simplex would benefit
from calling it to eliminate redundancies in equality
constraints. this would help fix some of its issues, e.g. #7044.

the new linprog function. it contains all the tests for the old

the audit log report currently raises an unhandled exception if it
tries to display log entries for model instances where the model was
deleted after the log entry was made. this commit fixes that bug.

if the model was deleted via a migration but the content type still
exists in the database (a ""stale content type"" in django parlance),
the report will now display a capitalized version of the content type's
""name"" field, for example ""homepage"" for the homepage model.

if the content type has also been deleted (likely via django's
remove_stale_contenttypes management command), the report will now
display the phrase ""unknown content type"".

before if a unaccounted for error happened during fqdn lookup then the
threadpool would exit without cleaning up. if, for instance you have a
malformed ptr record then something bad would happen with the lookup and
the fqdn function would exit without cleaning up the threadpool.

this fixed #59705 which had this exact problem.

i refactored this to use threadpoolexecutor which will actually cleanup
the threadpool on with-block exit. i also put a broad exception handler
in the fqdn internal function. this will prevent all but the most
egregious errors (i.e. ones that don't inherit from exception - e.g.
systemexit) from crashing the fqdn lookup process.

also took a couple of opportunities for refactor, such as the fact that

445,celery,0,5,issue,9,"fix: retain chord header result structure in redis

this change fixes the chord result flattening issue which manifested
when using the redis backend due to its deliberate throwing away of
information about the header result structure. rather than assuming that
all results which contribute to the finalisation of a chord should be
siblings, this change checks if any are complex (ie. `groupresult`s) and
falls back to behaviour similar to that implemented in the
`keyvaluestorebackend` which restores the original `groupresult` object
and `join()`s it.

we retain the original behaviour which is billed as an optimisation in
f09b041. we could behave better in the complex header result case by not
bothering to stash the results of contributing tasks under the `.j` zset
since we won't be using them, but without checking for the presence of
the complex group result on every `on_chord_part_return()` call, we
can't be sure that we won't need those stashed results later on. this
would be an opportunity for optimisation in future if we were to use an
`eval` to only do the `zadd()` if the group result key doesn't exist.
however, avoiding the result encoding work in `on_chord_part_return()`
would be more complicated. for now, it's not worth the brainpower.

this change also slightly refactors the redis backend unit tests to make
it easier to build fixtures and hit both the complex and simple result
structure cases.",maybe-sybr,2020-10-14 10:39:19+11:00,FALSE,Status: Not a Bug,https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/09,True,N,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Add a exception handling block,,,,,,Incorrect Behavior,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Unhandled Exception,Add a exception handling block,Exception handling block operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

473,ansible,0,6,issue,57038,"make query with errors='ignore' return a blank list (#57038)

the jinja2 query() function (or lookup with wantslist=true, which is
the same thing) should always return a list.

however, if you combine a query with errors='ignore' and take the
error path, the current code returns a none value.  this is important
in a case such as

 - name: conditional include file
   import_tasks: '{{ item }}'
   vars:
     params:
       files:
         - path/file1.yaml
         - path/file2.yaml
   loop: ""{{ q('first_found', params, errors='ignore') }}""

if neither file1.yaml or file2.yaml exist, this should do nothing by
returning an empty list to the loop.  currently if you run the above
task you'll get a rather unhelpful:

 invalid data passed to 'loop', it requires a list, got this instead: .

this change ensures that when a query ignores an error, it returns a
empty list.  the errors='ignore' case is tested in several variants
with first_found.  the extant (but deprecated) ""skip: true"" for
first_found doesn't seem to be explicitly tested; a test is added here
to avoid regressions before removal in 2.12.

this fixes a regression you'll hit if you follow the suggestion in the
deprecation message included with
e17a2b502d6601be53c60d7ba1c627df419460c9 to use errors=ignore over
""skip: true"" for first_found.  this change adds an example that points
out the query/lookup difference and also fixes the error message to
not mention the now deprecated ""skip: true"".

546,mypy,0,6,issue,2,"add support for calling functions with star args and star2 args (mypyc/mypyc#305)

closes https://github.com/jukkal/mypyc/issues/259.
adds a new primitive func_op for `_pylist_extend` for concatenating star args together.

also:

- renames args to arg_values in a few places to match py_call. the reasoning for this naming is that an argument has multiple properties: kind, type, and value.
- refactors irbuilder.translate_call, moving logic around.

not without a few caveats though. as of `mypy 0.630+dev-c13d6f1d9d20c6dec7c33a3c1b5f1e1f1a0b22d1`, mypy does not support extreme usages of `*` and `**`. for instance, in the snippet below, mypy will complain about all of the print statements, even though python runs the code just fine:
```python

print(g(**{'a': 1, 'c': 3}, b=2))

instead of a confusing mix of django_auth_backed applying

translation, and then custom logic for grabbing it from the email
attribute of the ldapuser in zulipldapauthbackend.get_or_build_user
for the second part of the translation,
we put all the logic in a single function user_email_from_ldapuser
which will be used by get_or_build of both zulipldapuserpopulator and
zulipldapauthbackend.

this, building on the previous commits with the email search feature,
fixes the ldap sync bug from issue #11878.

bug: fix if_exists='replace' functionality in io.sql.write_frame

this should resolve issues #2971 and #4110

cln: refactor in between test clean ups to be more dry

tst: complete test coverage for if_exists uses in io.sql.write_frame

cln: refactor to make interaction between exists and if_exists clearer

this refactor results in the function logic being clearer, since if_exists is
only relevant when exists is true, the program flow is better served to
have if_exists control flow only when exists is true

712,pytest,0,8,issue,37,"let unittest frameworks deal with async functions

instead of trying to handle unittest-async functions in pytest_pyfunc_call,
let the unittest framework handle them instead.

this lets us remove the hack in pytest_pyfunc_call, with the upside that
we should support any unittest-async based framework.

also included 'asynctest' as test dependency for py37-twisted, and renamed
'twisted' to 'unittestextras' to better reflect that we install 'twisted' and
'asynctest' now.

this also fixes the problem of cleanup functions not being properly called
for async functions.

fixes https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8495.

to further explain the problem here, `modify_kwargs_for_default_detection` as called in `add` is simplistic and doesn't always work. see https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6164 for one other example.

in this case, were bitten by the code https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/d1e7404358c05734aaf436ef3c9d709029d62b09/certbot/certbot/_internal/cli/helpful.py#l393-l395

the action used for deprecated arguments isn't in `zero_arg_actions` so it assumes that all deprecated flags take one parameter.

rather than trying to fix this function (which i think can only realistically be fixed by https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/4493), i took the approach that was previously used in `helpfulargumentparser.add_deprecated_argument` of bypassing this extra logic entirely. i adapted that function to now call `helpfulargumentparser.add` as well for consistency and to make testing easier.

this commit fixes issues with start/stop and selection. furthermore
select_as_mutlipe is implemented differently:
- select_column and remove now hanlde start/stop arguments
- select_as_multipe hanldes start/stop the same way as select
- select_as_coordinates and select_column works with where expressions
  that result in filters. this also fixes select_as_multipe with filters
- select_as_multipe table iterator is rewritting, so memory usage is
  constant.

select_as_multiple now will always throw a keyerror if either a key or
the selector is not found.

two issues exist:

2. `ec2.vpcpeeringconnection.vpc` is defined both as an attribute via its
   shape and via a `hasone` reference. the reference is renamed to
   `vpc_reference`.

## what do these changes do?

if no netrc environment variable is provided and the .netrc path cannot
be accessed due to missing permission, a permissionerror was raised
instead of returning none. see issue #7237. this pr fixes the issue.

if the changes look good, i can also prepare backports.

## are there changes in behavior for the user?

if the .netrc cannot be accessed due to a permission problem (and the
`netrc` environment variable is unset), no `permissionerror` will be
raised. instead it will be silently ignored.

854,ansible,0,8,issue,23096,"fix setting config with docker_config_file (#23096)

fixes #23095

fixed issue preventing a caller from setting a docker
configuration file (e.g. docker.yml) by specifing the
config file path in the `docker_config_file` environment
variable. previously, the cli argument parser set a default value for
the `--config-file` argument which would prevent ever checking the
environment variable, regardless of whether or not the `--config-file`
argument even specified a valid file.

this commit adds a global `default_docker_config_file` variable, which
points to the current default `docker.yml` config in the
contrib/inventory directory. now, when this script is called from the
command line, the config file passed with the cli `--config-file` arg
will be given the highest precedence; if it is absent, this script will
then check if the `docker_config_file` env var is set, and load the
config file specified if possible. if neither the environment variable
or cli argument are specified, then the script will attempt to parse the
config file `docker.yml` in this script's directory (if present).

if either the `docker_config_file` environment variable or the
`--config-file` argument are given but point to a nonexistant file, then
the script will print an error message and exit with an error code.

it is *not* an error condition if the fallback `docker.yml` does not
exist.",milo-minderbinder,2018-10-30 15:39:32-04:00,FALSE,"cloud,docker,community_review,c:inventory/contrib_script,affects_2.4,inventory,support:community,new_contributor,bug",https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23096,True,N,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Add a exception handling block,,,,,,Incorrect Behavior,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Unhandled Exception,Add a exception handling block,Exception handling block operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if remote_tmp is missing then there's something more basic wrong in the

be alerted in this case than to silently ignore it.

jborean and i have independently checked what happens if the user sets
ansible_remote_tmp to empty string and !!null and both cases work fine.

triggers the warning because it is probably not a directory that the

1030,scipy,1,2,issue,7847,"bug: linalg: fix speed regression in solve()

this fixes the speed regression in gh-7847. since the default
change of sv to svx the solve routine suffered a huge performance
penalty for anything but low order nrhs.

this commit fixes that issue by converting to the sx routines,
with condition number checking.

however, the main funtionality by using svx was the easy check
of the condition number to assert a non-singular matrix.
this commit adds a call to the con routines to extract the
appropriate condition number. this forces the addition of:

   - lamch (machine precision extraction)
   - gecon (condition number calculation from lu factorization)
   - lange (1/i-norm of matrix)

this commit adds a valueerror issued for complex matrices
an transposed=true (which was a bug in prior versions).
the complex transposed case could be solved, but it is ambiguous whether
it should be the transposed or hermitian transposed. hence, a valueerror is
raised. see master (#7879) for a fix.

a couple of additional tests have been added, mainly to check the arguments.",Nick Papior,2017-09-19 11:15:52+02:00,FALSE,"defect,scipy.linalg",https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7847,True,S,Exceptional error,Missing Raising Condition,Raise errors,N,S,Exceptional error,Missing Raising Condition,Raise errors,Incorrect Exceptions,Incorrect Exceptions,Missing Raising Condition,Missing Raising Condition,Add a raise condition,Improve raising conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the new file scipy/optimize/linprog_ip.py contains a new function,

the new linprog function works exactly the same way as the old one,
except that now the 'method' argument can be either ""simplex"" or
""interior-point"".

scipy/optimize/_removeredundancy.py contains a function
_removeredundancy that is used in the presolve procedure of
the interior point method. it's in a separate file as
scipy/optimize/_linprog/_linprog_simplex would benefit
from calling it to eliminate redundancies in equality
constraints. this would help fix some of its issues, e.g. #7044.

scipy/optimize/tests/test_linprog_ip contains the unit tests for
the new linprog function. it contains all the tests for the old
simplex method and several new tests, some of which would be relevant

1065,edgedb,1,2,issue,1184,"fix handling of schema-level aliases of aliases

this fixes a cluster of bugs that prevented referencing schema-level
aliases from other schema-level aliases properly:

- `declare_view_from_schema` should populate the compilation context
  sufficiently to properly resolve alias innards, but should otherwise
  return the aliased type variant exactly as it is already defined in
  the schema.  this is achieved through the addition of a special
  `recompiling_schema_alias` mode, which performs alias declaration
  as usual, but reuses the existing schema objects instead of creating
  them;

- aliases of aliases reuse nested aliased types, hence `drop alias`
  needs to be careful not to blindly destroy them (`if_unused` comes
  handy here).

1102,celery,1,2,issue,6930,"restart consumer if connection drops (#6930)

* restart consumer if the celery connection drops

original commit by @bremac https://github.com/celery/celery/commit/385a60df09201a17ad646c71eb1c00255d0a4431?diff=unified

previously if an ack or reject message failed because the connection
was unavailable then celery would stop accepting messages until it was
restarted. this problem is that the main celery loop is responsible for
detecting closed connections, but the connection errors would not always
reach the main loop.

there are three places in the celery that share a long-running amqp connection:

  1. the core worker loop listens for new messages.
  2. the ack / reject code that runs after a task completes.
  3. the heartbeat loop that keeps the connection alive.

neither of the first two are guaranteed to see an error if the connection drops.
the main listener may never see an error if the connection drops since it may be
swallowed by drain_events; the connection may drop while no work is being done,
so the ack / reject code will never be triggered.

fortunately the heartbeat loop is guaranteed to see an error if the connection
dies: periodic writes to the socket will fail with a broken pipe error.
unfortunately it runs in a separate thread, so previously connection errors were
swallowed silently.

this commit alters the heartbeat code so that heartbeat error are always
re-raised in the main loop. this triggers existing code in the worker that
restarts the worker, reestablishing the connection. with the fix in place i've
been able to trigger ten long-running (three minute) rca queries without the
worker hanging; without the fix it became unavailable after one or two queries.

* fix: heartbeat_error to object

* revert: heartbeat_error has to be pass by reference.

- preallocating the list avoids it from growing on each check

* fix: add comment

* add unit tests

* fix lint

* update call to args in test

1107,mypy,1,2,issue,71,"minimal exception support (mypyc/mypyc#71)

support propagating exceptions raised by ops to callers and generating stack traces.
exceptions still can't be manually raised or caught.

the idea is that each op describes whether it can raise an exception. exceptions must
be signaled through the result value of an op (either false or the undefined/error value).
we have an extra pass which inserts error check branches after each op that may fail,
and splits basic blocks accordingly. when initially building the ir, we generate no
exception check ops, since they can always be inserted automatically, similar to
reference counting ops.

this also fixes some not directly related bugs as they were needed to get tests passing.

some special cases are not handled yet but this seems about good enough to merge,
especially since this will cause merge conflicts with pretty much any other non-trivial

* [fix]: fix request error bug limiting requests

* [feat]: add dual poly. backoff + linear timer if request limit hit

add a dual polynomial + linear timer to allow for optimal fine grain
searching of twitter timeout value. a new arg `min_wait_time` allows
users to to do one of three things; firstly, if they know a value that
is optimal already then can input it directly allowing the timer to
stricty be a linear timer. secondly, if twitter suddenly changes their
timeout limit and the value no longer satifies the required amount,
the timer will decide the higher valued option between the polynomial
timer's and linear timer's next value so the application still
functions. third, as the linear timers min_wait_time arg goes to zero
the timer becomes strictly a polynomial backoff timer that allows the
user versatility and less likely to explode in the case of a change in
twitter request limit timeout.

* [wip] another attempt at a bugfix. the issue appears to be with numpy <1.21 rather than with pandas.

* since numpy was the issue rather than pandas 0.25, and that was dealt with in the type checking function, we can expand the nullable int test to include pandas 0.25

1189,numpy,1,3,issue,13056,"bug: fixes to numpy.distutils.configuration.get_version (#13056)

* bug: use subprocess.check_output to avoid leaking file handles

this emitted a resourcewarning as previously written, as the streams never got closed.

this change also detects errors in `svnversion` and `hg`, rather than ignoring the error code and hoping stdout contains a revision anyway.

* bug: fix distutils.get_version on python 3

previously, this would throw `typeerror: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object`, which would then be silenced and never seen.

the previous commit stopped silencing this error, so now everything is visibly broken rather than silently broken

changing the strings to raw strings fixes the problem

* bug: don't use `close_fds`, which fails on windows

1227,ansible,1,3,issue,49002,"reboot - fix errors when using paramiko connection (#49002)

different connection plugins return different data when throwing exceptions. the paramiko connection plugin does not return a text sting, which caused an exception.

the ssh connection plugin returns multi-line errors, which makes the debug logs harder to read. only return the last line in that case in order to make the logs more readable.

when experiencing a connection failure, reset the connection.

add reset() to paramiko_ssh

indicate thet conection state is false when running close(). this is needed by the ensure_connected() decorator to work properly.

1245,streamlit,1,3,issue,3218,"fix 3218, patch pydantic in_ipython function (#6664)

* fix 3218, patch pydantic in_ipython function to remove duplicate validator error
pydantic by default disallows to reuse of validators with the same name, this combined with the streamlit execution model leads to an error on the second streamlit script rerun if the pydantic validator is registered in the streamlit script.

it is important to note that the same issue exists for pydantic validators inside jupyter notebooks, pydantic/pydantic#312 , please see this comment and to fix that in pydantic they use the in_ipython function that checks that pydantic runs not in ipython environment (they try to eval('__ipython__') in that function)

https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/d61792cc42c80b13b23e3ffa74bc37ec7c77f7d1/pydantic/class_validators.py#l149

so to fix this error we have several options:

- open pr to pydantic v1 repo with the suggestion to add the in_streamlit function
this could be inefficient because active development in v1 branch is finished, and they concentrated to v2 development
- set __ipython__ flag in streamlit
this could lead to unexpected consequences, if other 3rd party libraries also refer to that flag.
- redefine in_ipython function inside bootstrap.py to return always true
changes in this commit

another relevant note is that the mechanism of duplicate detection completely rewritten for pydantic v2 (which has not yet been released), and this should not be an issue for pydantic 2.
pydantic/pydantic#5398 , and this should not be an issue for pydantic v2.

resuming all the above, this change will relax rules for writing pydantic validators inside streamlit script a little bit, similar to how it works in jupyter, which should not be critical.

this also should work correctly even if pydantic v2 is installed, since class_validators has been kept in v2 too.",Karen Javadyan,2023-05-31 14:18:30+04:00,FALSE,type:bug,https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3218,True,N,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Add a exception handling block,,,,,,Incorrect Behavior,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Unhandled Exception,Add a exception handling block,Exception handling block operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1269,certbot,1,5,issue,"fix add deprecated argument (#8500) (#8501)

fixes https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8495.

to further explain the problem here, `modify_kwargs_for_default_detection` as called in `add` is simplistic and doesn't always work. see https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6164 for one other example.

in this case, were bitten by the code https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/d1e7404358c05734aaf436ef3c9d709029d62b09/certbot/certbot/_internal/cli/helpful.py#l393-l395

the action used for deprecated arguments isn't in `zero_arg_actions` so it assumes that all deprecated flags take one parameter.

rather than trying to fix this function (which i think can only realistically be fixed by https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/4493), i took the approach that was previously used in `helpfulargumentparser.add_deprecated_argument` of bypassing this extra logic entirely. i adapted that function to now call `helpfulargumentparser.add` as well for consistency and to make testing easier.

* rename deprecated arg action class

* skip extra parsing for deprecated arguments

* add back test of --manual-public-ip-logging-ok

* add changelog entry

     added keyword 'raise_on_error' to astype, which can be set to false to exluded non-numeric columns
     fixed merging to correctly merge on multiple dtypes with blocks (e.g. float64 and float32 in other merger)
     changed implementation of get_dtype_counts() to use .blocks
     revised dataframe.convert_objects to use blocks to be more efficient
     added dtype printing to show on default with a series
     added convert_dates='coerce' option to convert_objects, to force conversions to datetime64[ns]

     no support for float16 (it can exist, but no cython methods for it)

tst: fixed test in test_from_records_sequencelike (dict orders can be different on different arch!)
       note: using tuples will remove dtype info from the input stream (using a record array is ok though!)

     respect the dtype of non-natural numeric (decimal)

1301,discord.py,1,5,issue,"ensure explicitly set parents on nested groups are respected

this had a multiple layer bug that needed to be squashed. the first
issue was that setting `parent=...` inside a `group` wouldn't actually
add the `group` into the `parent` children mapping. this meant that
it didn't actually end up copying the children when it came time to
within e.g. a cog.

the second issue was that even if it was added into the children
listing, it wouldn't properly set the attribute.

this commit fixes both of these issues.

1314,celery,1,5,issue,"use gevent and eventlet wait() functions to remove busy-wait (#5974)

* use gevent and eventlet wait() functions to remove busy-wait

fixes issue #4999.

calling asyncresult.get() in a gevent context would cause the async drainer to repeatedly call wait_for until the result was completed.  i've updated the code to have a specific implementation for gevent and eventlet that will cause wait_for to only return every ""timeout"" # of seconds, rather than repeatedly returning.

some things i'd like some feedback on:
* where's the best place to add test coverage for this?  it doesn't look like there are any tests that directly exercised the drainer yet so i would probably look to add some of these to the backends/ unit tests.
* the way i did this for the eventlet interface was to rely on the private _exit_event member of the greenthread instance; to do this without relying on a private member would require some additional changes to the backend drainer interface so that we could wait for an eventlet-specific event in wait_for().  i can do this, just wanted to get some feedback before.

* add unit tests for drainer classes

in order for this to work without monkeypatching in the tests, i needed to call sleep(0) to let the gevent/eventlet greenlets to yield control back to the calling thread.  i also made the check interval configurable in the drainer so that we didn't need to sleep multiples of 1 second in the tests.

* weaken asserts since they don't pass on ci

* fix eventlet auto-patching dns resolver module on import

by default it looks like ""import eventlet"" imports the greendns module unless the environment eventlet_no_greendns is set to true.  this broke a pymongo test.

* add tests ensuring that the greenlet loop isn't blocked

these tests make sure that while drain_events_until is running that other gevent/eventlet concurrency can run.

* clean up tests and make sure they wait for all the threads to stop",Dave King,2020-02-28 17:53:53-08:00,FALSE,PR Type: Bugfix,6892beb33b4c6950d2fd28bf633ff320d972afe5,https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/5974,True,N,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Add a exception handling block,,,,,,Incorrect Behavior,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Unhandled Exception,Add a exception handling block,Exception handling block operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1323,salt,1,5,issue,"fix issue #11727: got a bad pillar from master

i was able to reproduce this issue consistently in my environment.

the minion would receive an empty string '' as pillar data instead of
the expected pillar data. the reason for this is that in
salt/master.py: _pillar()
it would invoke:
for func in six.itervalues(self.mminion.functions):

which would cause a _load_all() in salt/loader.py

this would eventually cause an exception when loading:
salt/modules/boto_vpc.py (at line 113):
__utils__['boto.assign_funcs'](__name__, 'vpc')

with: keyerror('boto.assign_funcs',)
which probably means that 'boto.assign_funcs' isn't in __utils__ at the
time of invocation.

however, this commit will not fix the problem in boto_vpc.py. i will
leave this up to a domain expert.

the focus of this commit is to make the loader capable of cleanly
handling errors while invoking '__init__' in loaded modules.

1347,octoprint,1,5,issue,"🐛 fix exception not being retrieved on socket error

this should hopefully close #3689

the actual result of writing to the web socket is async and a future,
since `write_message` (https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/v5.1.1/tornado/websocke.py#l848)
returns a future. the error handling inside `send_pack` however
so far assumed synchronous behaviour (same for `rawwebsocket.py`).
thus the exception handler there will not trigger if there's an error
while writing, and thus the connection will not have `on_close` called.

this commit works around this through a `done_callback` on the future,
which should hopefully solve it. i say should because even though i did
my best in trying to simulate the error scenario, i was never able to
trigger even the ""retrieved"" message, let alone a whole storm of them.",Gina Häußge,2020-09-04 17:37:29+02:00,FALSE,"unreproduced,bug,done,approved",e91fcd6387c96d8aa92070f7a14b6558773446d1,https://github.com/octoprint/octoprint/issues/3689,True,S,"Exceptional

`read_csv` bugs, this pr fixes a bug brought up in #9755 in processing
`parse_dates` with the c engine in which the wrong indices (those of
the filtered column names) were being used to determine the date
columns to not be dtype-parsed by the c engine. the correct indices
are those of the original column names, as they are used later on in
the actual data processing.

1400,mlflow,1,5,issue,"fix bug when environment run id overrides set_experiment (#1820)

## what changes are proposed in this pull request?

adds a check in `start_run()` to make sure `_active_experiment_id` isn't set by `set_experiment()` when a run id is supplied by the environment. the main reason this happens is when `--experiment-name` or `--experiment-id` is set from the cli, it will create a run on that experiment. afterwards, a user might assume they can also reference the run with `set_experiment()`, maybe providing a different name to override the cli. before, it would allow the user to use `set_experiment()` and it would create a new experiment from `set_experiment()`, however it would log results to the experiment set from cli. now, it will throw an `mlflowexception` if both are set.

1403,ansible,1,5,issue,"prevent losing unsafe from lookups (#77609)

* prevent losing unsafe from lookups

this patch fixes a bug which under certain conditions results in data
returned from lookups not being marked as unsafe.

each time templar.do_template is invoked a new ansiblecontext is
created and stored effectively at two places:
1) as an instance variable in templar_obj.cur_context
2) as a local variable called new_context in do_template method of templar

due to custom functionality in ansible's context that allows for nested
templating it is possible that during resolving variable's value
template/do_template method is called recursively again, again creating
a new context. at that point the problem manifests itself because as
mentioned in 1) above the context is overwriten on the templar object
which means that any subsequent calls to _lookup will use the new
context to mark it as unsafe which is now different to the local
new_context which is used for testing for unsafe property.

the solution to the problem appears to be to restore the original
context inside do_template and also to eliminate the local variable
new_context to prevent problems in the future.

it appears that we don't have a better way of storing the context other
than as some form of global variable and so this appears to be the
""best"" solution possible at this point. hopefully data tagging will be
the solution here.

for more examples see unit and integration tests included in this patch.

> discovered while trying to make synapse fast enough for [this msc2716 test for importing many batches](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/pull/214#discussion_r741678240). as an example, disabling the `have_seen_event` cache saves 10 seconds for each `/messages` request in that msc2716 complement test because we're not making as many federation requests for `/state` (speeding up `have_seen_event` itself is related to https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13625)

> 
> *-- https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13856*


### the problem

`_invalidate_caches_for_event` doesn't run in monolith mode which means we never even tried to clear the `have_seen_event` and other caches. and even in worker mode, it only runs on the workers, not the master (afaict).

additionally there was bug with the key being wrong so `_invalidate_caches_for_event` never invalidates the `have_seen_event` cache even when it does run.

because we were using the `@cachedlist` wrong, it was putting items in the cache under keys like `((room_id, event_id),)` with a `set` in a `set` (ex. `(('!tncijpkzdqduliyxdq:test', '$iu0eqebn7qcyf1s9b3onb3i91v2o5yogrnpwi_78s-k'),)`) and we we're trying to invalidate with just `(room_id, event_id)` which did nothing.",Eric Eastwood,2022-09-27 15:55:43-05:00,FALSE,"T-Defect,A-Messages-Endpoint",https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13863,True,N,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Add a exception handling block,,,,,,Incorrect Behavior,Incorrect Behavior,Missing Exception Type,Unhandled Exception,Add a exception handling block,Exception handling block operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1485,jax,1,7,issue,1521,"avoid broadcasting the input and indices in jnp.take_along_axis.

in #1521 we added broadcasting to fix an apparent wrong-gradient bug. this
worked, but the real issue was that we were mishandling the case where the
array dimension is of size 1 but the index dimension is not. in that case we
in essence gathered a bunch of out of bounds indices, leading to apparently
incorrect gradients.

the previous fix (broadcasting) worked, but was suboptimal in terms of

this reverts commit c088383cb290ca064d456e89d79177a0e234cb8d and
uses the same kind casting rule for the additional keyword arguments
``to_end`` and ``to_begin``. this results in slightly more leniant
behaviour for integers (which can now have overflows that are
hidden), but fixes an issue with the handling of nan.
generally, this behaviour seems more conistent with what numpy does
elsewhere. the overflow issue exists similar in many other places
and should be solved by integer overflow warning machinery while
the actual cast takes place.

  treated as an error

  displaying of docs assumes that this has been set.

* if there is neither documentation nor ansible_metadata, warn about the
  lack of metadata and error on the lack of documentation.  lack of
  documentation is more important so it is what the user should see.
