292,zulip,4,issue,2016,"cve-2016-4427: fix access by deactivated realms/users.

the security model for deactivated users (and users in deactivated
realms) being unable to access the service is intended to work via two
mechanisms:

* all active user sessions are deleted, and all login code paths
  (where a user could get a new session) check whether the user (or
  realm) is inactive before authorizing the request, preventing the
  user from accessing the website and ajax endpoints.
* all api code paths (which don't require a session) check whether the
  user (and realm) are active.

however, this security model was not implemented correctly.  in
particular, the check for whether a user has an active account in the
login process was done inside the login form's validators, which meant
that authentication mechanisms that did not use the login form
(e.g. google and remote_user auth) could succeed in granting a session
even with an inactive account.  the zulip homepage would still fail to
load because the code for / includes an api call to tornado authorized
by the user's token that would fail, but this mechanism could allow an
inactive user to access realm data or users to access data in a
deactivated realm.

this fixes the issue by adding explicit checks for inactive users and
inactive realms in all authentication backends (even those that were
already protected by the login form validator).

mirror dummy users are already inactive, so we can remove the explicit
code around mirror dummy users.

the following commits add a complete set of tests for zulip's inactive
user and realm security model.",Tim Abbott,2016-04-20 22:19:08-07:00,False,"bug,area: real-time sync,area: stream settings",https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/2016,True,N,-,-,-,-,-,-,,,-,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* cython debugger documentation: added link to an installation script.
* got a new libpython.py from the cpython source distribution.
* default language level in tests is now 3 instead of 2
* migrated codefile from python 2 to python 3.
* added testcase for the cy list command in cygdb.
* temporarily removing test case that freezes gdb.
* fixed a bug that broke several cygdb tests.

the cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* files map the names of the c-functions generated by the cython compiler to the names of the functions in the *.pyx source. if the function was defined using ""def"" (and not ""cpdef"" or ""cdef"") in the *.pyx source file, the c-function named in cython_debug/cython_debug_info_* used to be __pyx_pw_*, which is the name of the wrapper function and now it is __pyx_f_*, which is the name of the actual function. this makes some cygdb tests pass that did not pass before.

* better error messages: if a cygdb command raises, a traceback will be printed.
* fixed a bug in cygdb.

the following now works:
1. start cygdb
2. type ""cy exec"" and hit enter
3. type some other lines
4. type ""end"" and hit enter.
-> these ""other lines"" will get executed

* fixed a bug in cygdb: cy list now works outside of functions.
* added print_hr_allmarkers function for easier debugging.
* fixed a bug that broke cygdb:

some of the shortest_path functions have a fast-path for the case when source==target.
in some of these functions, there was no check that the source node was in the graph,
leading to incorrect results when a nodenotfound error would be more appropriate.
this pr fixes these cases.

in addition, checking that nodes are actually in the graph was formerly done in the internal
`_dijkstra_multisource` function. these checks have been factored out and moved to the
client functions for efficiency and to prevent redundant checking.

343,salt,4,issue,6048,"fix issue with cp.get_dir copying more than intended

the get_dir member function of the salt fileclient was doing a simple
check to see if the path of a target file (or empty dir) started with
the specified salt:// path. as a result, salt://foo would match files
like salt://foo.sh or files within the directory salt://foobar/.

this commit adds a check to ensure that these undesired files/dirs are

* fix: use chord kwarg over request in group.apply

* fix: propagate errors from failed chain tasks

fixes #6220

co-authored-by: maximilian friedersdorff <max@friedersdorff.com>
co-authored-by: maybe-sybr <58414429+maybe-sybr@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix: ensure all subtasks of a group get errbacks

giving a linked task callback to the 0th task in a group is fine, but
for errbacks it's not an appropriate choice since any task in the group
could fail. this ensures that if any task other than the 0th one fails,
the errback will be called. this opens the possibility for an errback to
be called more than once when linked to a group, but generally we expect
that they should be design to be idempotent so no warning is issued for
the changed behaviour.

* test: add tests for child error propagation

* test: add regression tests for group errback dupes

these tests simply encode the currently expected behaviour where
errbacks linked to a group will be called once for each failed task, as
well as the consequences for chords which turn their header into a group
if it is not one already.

* doc: add extra docs for canvas call/errback usage

the new file scipy/optimize/linprog_ip.py contains a new function,
linprog, intended to replace the one in scipy/optimize/_linprog.py.
the new linprog function works exactly the same way as the old one,
except that now the 'method' argument can be either ""simplex"" or
""interior-point"".

scipy/optimize/_removeredundancy.py contains a function
_removeredundancy that is used in the presolve procedure of
the interior point method. it's in a separate file as
scipy/optimize/_linprog/_linprog_simplex would benefit
from calling it to eliminate redundancies in equality
constraints. this would help fix some of its issues, e.g. #7044.

scipy/optimize/tests/test_linprog_ip contains the unit tests for
the new linprog function. it contains all the tests for the old
simplex method and several new tests, some of which would be relevant

exists in the database (a ""stale content type"" in django parlance),
the report will now display a capitalized version of the content type's
""name"" field, for example ""homepage"" for the homepage model.

before if a unaccounted for error happened during fqdn lookup then the
threadpool would exit without cleaning up. if, for instance you have a
malformed ptr record then something bad would happen with the lookup and
the fqdn function would exit without cleaning up the threadpool.

this fixed #59705 which had this exact problem.

i refactored this to use threadpoolexecutor which will actually cleanup
the threadpool on with-block exit. i also put a broad exception handler
in the fqdn internal function. this will prevent all but the most
egregious errors (i.e. ones that don't inherit from exception - e.g.
systemexit) from crashing the fqdn lookup process.

also took a couple of opportunities for refactor, such as the fact that
`sorted` takes any iterable and returns a list, so i could remove that

425,numba,5,issue,8105,"add explicit checks to all allocators in the nrt.

this patch:

* updates nrt.c to ensure that allocation routines return null if
  the allocation fails. cf. malloc.
* updates the nrt.context to add a check that wraps any allocation
  routine to check if the allocation failed and if so raises a
  memoryerror.
* fixes the runtime system allocators to catch invalid allocation
  requests and handle failed allocation requests.
* adds tests for the above.
* fixes a storage classifier issue in the c code in the nrt tests.
* adds the option `--debuginfo` to the `build_ext` command in
  setup.py, on unix systems this will ensure the dsos numba
  produces are built with debug symbols.
* adds an update to the notes in nrt_external.h about the expected
  behaviour of an externally supplied allocation routine.

445,celery,5,issue,9,"fix: retain chord header result structure in redis

this change fixes the chord result flattening issue which manifested
when using the redis backend due to its deliberate throwing away of
information about the header result structure. rather than assuming that
all results which contribute to the finalisation of a chord should be
siblings, this change checks if any are complex (ie. `groupresult`s) and
falls back to behaviour similar to that implemented in the
`keyvaluestorebackend` which restores the original `groupresult` object
and `join()`s it.

we retain the original behaviour which is billed as an optimisation in
f09b041. we could behave better in the complex header result case by not
bothering to stash the results of contributing tasks under the `.j` zset
since we won't be using them, but without checking for the presence of
the complex group result on every `on_chord_part_return()` call, we
can't be sure that we won't need those stashed results later on. this
would be an opportunity for optimisation in future if we were to use an
`eval` to only do the `zadd()` if the group result key doesn't exist.
however, avoiding the result encoding work in `on_chord_part_return()`
would be more complicated. for now, it's not worth the brainpower.

this change also slightly refactors the redis backend unit tests to make
it easier to build fixtures and hit both the complex and simple result
structure cases.",maybe-sybr,2020-10-14 10:39:19+11:00,False,Status: Not a Bug,https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/09,True,N,Exceptional Error,,,,,,Exceptional Error,Exceptional Error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

473,ansible,6,issue,57038,"make query with errors='ignore' return a blank list (#57038)

the jinja2 query() function (or lookup with wantslist=true, which is
the same thing) should always return a list.

however, if you combine a query with errors='ignore' and take the
error path, the current code returns a none value.  this is important
in a case such as

 - name: conditional include file
   import_tasks: '{{ item }}'
   vars:
     params:
       files:
         - path/file1.yaml
         - path/file2.yaml
   loop: ""{{ q('first_found', params, errors='ignore') }}""

if neither file1.yaml or file2.yaml exist, this should do nothing by
returning an empty list to the loop.  currently if you run the above
task you'll get a rather unhelpful:

 invalid data passed to 'loop', it requires a list, got this instead: .

this change ensures that when a query ignores an error, it returns a
empty list.  the errors='ignore' case is tested in several variants
with first_found.  the extant (but deprecated) ""skip: true"" for
first_found doesn't seem to be explicitly tested; a test is added here
to avoid regressions before removal in 2.12.

this fixes a regression you'll hit if you follow the suggestion in the
deprecation message included with
e17a2b502d6601be53c60d7ba1c627df419460c9 to use errors=ignore over
""skip: true"" for first_found.  this change adds an example that points
out the query/lookup difference and also fixes the error message to
not mention the now deprecated ""skip: true"".

adds a new primitive func_op for `_pylist_extend` for concatenating star args together.

- renames args to arg_values in a few places to match py_call. the reasoning for this naming is that an argument has multiple properties: kind, type, and value.
- refactors irbuilder.translate_call, moving logic around.

not without a few caveats though. as of `mypy 0.630+dev-c13d6f1d9d20c6dec7c33a3c1b5f1e1f1a0b22d1`, mypy does not support extreme usages of `*` and `**`. for instance, in the snippet below, mypy will complain about all of the print statements, even though python runs the code just fine:
```python
from typing import tuple

def g(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]:
    return a, b, c

print(g(**{'a': 1}, **{'b': 2, 'c': 3}))
print(g(**{'a': 1, 'c': 3}, b=2))
print(g(*[1], b=2, **{'c': 3}))
```
as a result, functions calls like in the snippet above are also not supported by mypyc.",ed1d1a8d,2018-07-20 18:11:21-07:00,False,bug,https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2,True,N,Exceptional Error,,,,,,Exceptional Error,Exceptional Error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

instead of a confusing mix of django_auth_backed applying

attribute of the ldapuser in zulipldapauthbackend.get_or_build_user

we put all the logic in a single function user_email_from_ldapuser

fixes the ldap sync bug from issue #11878.

the if_exists argument in io.sql.write_frame needed data validation
because the logic of the function implicitly used 'append' if the argument
value was any string that was not either 'fail' or 'replace'.
i added a new unit test to support the requirement.

bug: fix if_exists='replace' functionality in io.sql.write_frame

this should resolve issues #2971 and #4110

cln: refactor in between test clean ups to be more dry

tst: complete test coverage for if_exists uses in io.sql.write_frame

cln: refactor to make interaction between exists and if_exists clearer

this refactor results in the function logic being clearer, since if_exists is
only relevant when exists is true, the program flow is better served to
have if_exists control flow only when exists is true

712,pytest,8,issue,37,"let unittest frameworks deal with async functions

instead of trying to handle unittest-async functions in pytest_pyfunc_call,
let the unittest framework handle them instead.

this lets us remove the hack in pytest_pyfunc_call, with the upside that
we should support any unittest-async based framework.

also included 'asynctest' as test dependency for py37-twisted, and renamed
'twisted' to 'unittestextras' to better reflect that we install 'twisted' and
'asynctest' now.

this also fixes the problem of cleanup functions not being properly called
for async functions.

724,certbot,8,issue,8500,"fix add deprecated argument (#8500)

fixes https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/8495.

to further explain the problem here, `modify_kwargs_for_default_detection` as called in `add` is simplistic and doesn't always work. see https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6164 for one other example.

in this case, were bitten by the code https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/d1e7404358c05734aaf436ef3c9d709029d62b09/certbot/certbot/_internal/cli/helpful.py#l393-l395

the action used for deprecated arguments isn't in `zero_arg_actions` so it assumes that all deprecated flags take one parameter.

rather than trying to fix this function (which i think can only realistically be fixed by https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/4493), i took the approach that was previously used in `helpfulargumentparser.add_deprecated_argument` of bypassing this extra logic entirely. i adapted that function to now call `helpfulargumentparser.add` as well for consistency and to make testing easier.

836,ansible,8,issue,63580,"galaxy publish fix (#63580)

* handle galaxy v2/v3 api diffs for artifact publish response

for publishing a collection artifact
(post /v3/collections/artifacts/), the response
format is different between v2 and v3.

for v2 galaxy, the 'task' url returned is
a full url with scheme:

        {""task"": ""https://galaxy-dev.ansible.com/api/v2/collection-imports/35573/""}

for v3 galaxy, the task url is relative:

        {""task"": ""/api/automation-hub/v3/imports/collections/838d1308-a8f4-402c-95cb-7823f3806cd8/""}

so check which api we are using and update the task url approriately.

* use full url for all wait_for_import messages

update unit tests to parameterize the expected
responses and urls.

* update explanatory comment

* rename n_url to full_url.

* fix issue with overwrite of the complete path

* fixes overwrite of the complete path in case there's extra path stored
  in self.api_sever
* normalizes the input to the wait_import_task function so it receives
  the same value on both v2 and v3

builds on #63523

* update unittests for new call signature

839,aiohttp,8,issue,7237,"fix permissionerror when loading .netrc (#7237) (#7378)

## what do these changes do?

if no netrc environment variable is provided and the .netrc path cannot
be accessed due to missing permission, a permissionerror was raised
instead of returning none. see issue #7237. this pr fixes the issue.

if the changes look good, i can also prepare backports.

## are there changes in behavior for the user?

if the .netrc cannot be accessed due to a permission problem (and the
`netrc` environment variable is unset), no `permissionerror` will be
raised. instead it will be silently ignored.

854,ansible,8,issue,23096,"fix setting config with docker_config_file (#23096)

fixes #23095

fixed issue preventing a caller from setting a docker
configuration file (e.g. docker.yml) by specifing the
config file path in the `docker_config_file` environment
variable. previously, the cli argument parser set a default value for
the `--config-file` argument which would prevent ever checking the
environment variable, regardless of whether or not the `--config-file`
argument even specified a valid file.

this commit adds a global `default_docker_config_file` variable, which
points to the current default `docker.yml` config in the
contrib/inventory directory. now, when this script is called from the
command line, the config file passed with the cli `--config-file` arg
will be given the highest precedence; if it is absent, this script will
then check if the `docker_config_file` env var is set, and load the
config file specified if possible. if neither the environment variable
or cli argument are specified, then the script will attempt to parse the
config file `docker.yml` in this script's directory (if present).

if either the `docker_config_file` environment variable or the
`--config-file` argument are given but point to a nonexistant file, then
the script will print an error message and exit with an error code.

it is *not* an error condition if the fallback `docker.yml` does not
exist.",milo-minderbinder,2018-10-30 15:39:32-04:00,False,"cloud,docker,community_review,c:inventory/contrib_script,affects_2.4,inventory,support:community,new_contributor,bug",https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23096,True,N,Exceptional Error,,,,,,Exceptional Error,Exceptional Error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
